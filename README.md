# Vision-system-on-UR10e
Neurologically challenged patients have a hard time finding and holding their medications properly and require a nurse to assist them whenever they need their meds, which can go up to 5 times a day for over 30 patients. I developed a vision system on a UR10e cobot where a central UR10 can give medications to 4 patients at a time within its workspace. Implementing projection of 3D space to the 2D plane for recognizing the boes to using a tactile sensor for the depth of the boxes, the bot can pick the box and deliver it to the required patient. Methods like circularity, contour detection, homography, FK, and IK were used to plan the motion and detect the appropriate medicine among all equipment present in a hospital. The final report has been attached to this repository.
